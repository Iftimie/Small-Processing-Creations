# Processing creations
This repository contains some of my work when I started learning programming.
Processing is a great framework based on Java programming language. It is popular because of the simple sintax and the power to create amazing visual programs from a few lines of code.
Processing is mostly used in education.
When I began to be interested in artificial intelligence and how to model the real world, I came across a great online book called  [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/book/introduction/) written by Daniel Shiffman. There I found how genetic algorithms work and how to make a "rocket" evolve to reach it's destination in a 2D world.

Therefore I present here my self-assigned projects that helped me understand programming:

1. Finnaly the snake
The title comes from my frustration that I had while programming this.
The ideea is that I wanted to program a snake that has a smooth motion while chasing the mouse.
